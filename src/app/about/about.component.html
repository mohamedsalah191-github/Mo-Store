      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our small online store, where technology meets fashion! This store has been created purely for training purposes to explore and master Angular and API integration techniques. Our store showcases a variety of products, including electronics, clothing, accessories, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The products you see here are retrieved from a public API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products), giving us the opportunity to practice working with real data in a dynamic environment. This store is not a real commercial platform but rather a sandbox for learning and experimenting with web development technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that this training experience will enhance our skills and provide valuable insights into modern web development practices, enabling us to build more robust and scalable applications in the future.
